            <p>A doctor is a certified medical expert who is educated to treat people with various health 
                concerns. They treat patients with various health concerns based on their 
                specialties. Doctors employ several diagnostic tests to establish the 
                conditions that are causing the patient's ailment and then treat them 
                accordingly. After finishing their education, doctors might choose to work 
                in their own clinic or in any other healthcare facility.<br><br>

            <h4 id="list-item-2" class="prof">Engineer</h4>
            <p>Engineering is the art of applying scientific and mathematical principles, experience, judgment, and common sense to make things that benefit people. Engineers design bridges and important medical equipment as well as processes for cleaning up toxic spills and systems for mass transit. Engineering is the process of producing a technical product or system to meet a specific need.
                <br>To become an engineer, the typical path involves earning a bachelor's degree in engineering, which generally takes around four to five years of full-time study. In some countries, like the United States, it usually takes four years to complete a bachelor's degree in engineering. However, in certain European countries, three years of academic study are required.
                <br>Once you clear the relevant entrance examinations, start applying to engineering colleges that offer the courses in which you want to specialise. Check the eligibility criteria, admission procedures and the required entrance exam score or ranking for each course you are considering. You can apply either through college websites or through centralised admission portals. Carefully fill in the application forms with all necessary details, attach any required documents, such as mark sheets, certificates and photographs, and pay the application fee if necessary.

            <h4 id="list-item-3" class="prof">Athlete</h4>
            <p>Becoming an athlete is a lifelong process that requires dedication, focus, and plenty of physical abilities. If you want to be an athlete, you can start by picking a sport that you love and then practicing it to become as skilled as you can be. In addition to playing the sport, athletes also need to eat a healthy diet, keep in condition, and lead a healthy, balanced life.
                <br>Most athletes get involved in sports when they're children, but it's possible to become an athlete at any age. Pick a sport that you’re interested in, and find a local club, team, or league to play with.
                <br>When you're practicing, work on one specific skill at a time. Repeat that movement or motion over and over until you perfect it. Engage your mind by thinking about what you’re doing and where you can improve.
                <br>When you finish working on a skill, step away from your workout to rest and rehydrate during a break. Spend time stretching your muscles or jogging in place to keep your heart rate up.

            <h4 id="list-item-4" class="prof">Chef</h4>
            <p>A chef is a professional cook and tradesman who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation, often focusing on a particular cuisine. The word "chef" is derived from the term chef de cuisine (French pronunciation: [ʃɛf də kɥizin]), the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive formal training from an institution, as well as by apprenticing with an experienced chef.
                <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style=""><tbody style=""><tr style=""><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Particulars</strong></p></td><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Details</strong></p></td></tr><tr style=""><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">Average Starting Salary : &nbsp;</p></td><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">0.2-9.7 LPA</p></td></tr><tr style=""><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">Highest Salary&nbsp;</p></td><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">9.7 LPA</p></td></tr></tbody></table></p>

                There are different terms that use the word chef in their titles, and deal with specific areas of food preparation. Examples include the sous-chef, who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, and the chef de partie, who handles a specific area of production. The kitchen brigade system is a hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, many of which use the word "chef" in their titles. Underneath the chefs are the kitchen assistants. A chef's standard uniform includes a hat (called a toque), neckerchief, double-breasted jacket, apron and sturdy shoes (that may include steel or plastic toe-caps).
            <br>
            Education is available from many culinary institutions offering diploma, associate, and bachelor's degree programs in culinary arts. Depending on the level of education, this can take one to four years. An internship is often part of the curriculum. Regardless of the education received, most professional kitchens follow the apprenticeship system, and most new cooks will start at a lower-level 2nd or 1st cook position and work their way up.<br><br>

            <h4 id="list-item-5" class="prof">Fashion Designer</h4>
            <p>Fashion designers work in a variety of different ways when designing their pieces and accessories such as rings, bracelets, necklaces and earrings. Due to the time required to put a garment out in market, designers must anticipate changes to consumer desires. Fashion designers are responsible for creating looks for individual garments, involving shape, color, fabric, trimming, and more.[2]

                Fashion designers attempt to design clothes that are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn, and they work within a wide range of materials, colors, patterns, and styles. Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within a narrow range of conventional styles, unusual garments are usually sought for special occasions such as evening wear or party dresses.
                  <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style=""><tbody style=""><tr style=""><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Particulars</strong></p></td><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Details</strong></p></td></tr><tr style=""><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">Average Starting Salary : &nbsp;</p></td><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">INR 0.3 to 7.2 LPA</p></td></tr><tr style=""><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">Highest Salary&nbsp;</p></td><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">60 LPA</p></td></tr></tbody></table></p>

                Some clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of haute couture or bespoke tailoring. Today, most clothing is designed for the mass market, especially casual and everyday wear, which are commonly known as ready to wear or fast fashion.
            <br>Fashion designers work in wholesale or manufacturing establishments, apparel companies, retailers, theater or dance companies, and design firms. Most fashion designers work in New York and California.<br><br>

            <h4 id="list-item-6" class="prof">Artist</h4>
            <p>An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse refers to a practitioner in the visual arts only. However, the term is also often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (although less often for actors). "Artiste" (French for artist) is a variant used in English in this context, but this use has become rare. The use of the term "artist" to describe writers is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts such as critics' reviews.<br>
                If you're wondering how to become an artist, you may want to know that it's not necessary to attend art school. While many artists have a degree in art subjects like drawing, graphic design or sculpture, amateur artists can develop their skills through an internship or apprenticeship with a professional artist. It's important to interact with other like-minded artists and establish a network of contacts with whom you can share ideas and experiences.
                <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style=""><tbody style=""><tr style=""><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Particulars</strong></p></td><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Details</strong></p></td></tr><tr style=""><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">Average Starting Salary : &nbsp;</p></td><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">0.2 to 3.5 LPA</p></td></tr><tr style=""><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">Highest Salary&nbsp;</p></td><td style=""><p style="text-align:center;">9.0 LPA</p></td></tr></tbody></table></p>

                Many self-taught artists have honed their skills through practice and experience. If you feel you'd benefit from professional guidance to improve your skills, you could enrol in a community class. Enquire at your local library or art supplier for details of local classes or workshops.
